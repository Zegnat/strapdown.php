# Strapdown.php

A proof-of-concept for replacing blocks of Markdown in HTML with its converted
HTML, inspired by [Strapdown.js](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown). It
isnâ€™t strictly limited to Markdown, but only comes with a Markdown converter
for now.

It works by looking for `xmp` elements that have a custom attribute
`data-language`. If this attribute matches the name for a converter, that
converter is asked to convert the contents of the `xmp` element. The results of
this conversion will replace the `xmp` element.

The attribute is called `data-language` as it is recommended to use MIME types
for format identification. This will allow several formats and several
converters to work on the same HTML file.
